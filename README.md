## Welcome to TDL2

Truly Dynamic Lighting 2 (or TDL2) is the more advanced iteration and successor to my original module, Truly Dynamic Lighting (or TDL).  This version aims to be more lightweight , more customizable, and easier to use than the original TDL, all while retaining the same original features.

## Brief Feature List

- [Served Sided or Client Sided Options]
- [Turn on/off lights]
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/httpsKingPie/httpsKingPie.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/httpsKingPie/httpsKingPie.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
