# Welcome to TDL2

Truly Dynamic Lighting 2 (or TDL2) is the more advanced iteration and successor to my original module, Truly Dynamic Lighting (or TDL).  This version aims to be more lightweight , more customizable, and easier to use than the original TDL, all while retaining the same original features.

## How do I use TDL2?
TDL2 takes a different approach than the original TDL.  It comes in more of a package setting.  You can always download the most up to date version directly from the github as a .rbmx model.  Alternatively, you can check out it's toolbox page (ADD TOOLBOX PAGE HERE).

_Once in Game_

1. I recommend putting the TDL2 folder in ReplicatedStorage.  This way, you have the freedom to change it from server sided to client sided at the touch of a button.
2. Adjust the Settings module.  There should be a brief documentation within the script, but a more detailed overview can be found [here](https://github.com/httpsKingPie/httpsKingPie.github.io/blob/master/README.md#settings-overview)
3. Make a copy of the FullSettingsExample, and paste it into either LightingSettings or WeatherSettings, depending on what you are trying to adjust.
4. Adjust the settings for the LightingSettings and WeatherSettings.  Feel free to remove any settings that you do not plan to change.  The settings page can be as big or small as you like.  Make sure your lighting periods are continuous!
5. Add a Day/Night cycle in.  It doesn't matter what kind, since the script is able to auto sync the times for your lighting periods with the day/night cycle so that it activates at the correct point.
6. Enjoy!  Let me know if you have any questions!
